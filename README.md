# Ideological differences between political parties in USA
#The data for this project was obtained from voteview.org. The project analyzes how the differences in party ideology in the US Congress changed during recent times. The project defines “recent times” as the last three US Presidential administrations.  The project also breaks down the data into regions to see how any regional trends. Finally, the project attempts to isolate any significant impact the last recorded financial catastrophe, the 2008 recession, had on party ideology.
